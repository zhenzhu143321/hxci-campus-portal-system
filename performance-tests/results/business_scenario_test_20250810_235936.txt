INTELLIGENT NOTIFICATION SYSTEM - BUSINESS SCENARIO PERFORMANCE REPORT
Generated: 08/11/2025 00:00:34
======================================================================

OBJECTIVE: Test system performance under realistic business scenarios

TEST SCENARIOS:
1. Authentication Storm - 50 concurrent authentication requests
2. Notification Query Storm - 100 concurrent notification list queries  
3. Notification Publishing Pressure - 25 concurrent notification publications
4. Mixed Workload Simulation - Realistic traffic pattern simulation
