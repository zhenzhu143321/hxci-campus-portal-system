INTELLIGENT NOTIFICATION SYSTEM - STRESS TEST SUMMARY
Generated: 08/10/2025 23:57:02
=====================================================

OBJECTIVE: Determine system stress limits and performance degradation points

TEST METHODOLOGY:
- Progressive stress testing from 50 to 500 concurrent users
- Focus on system health check API (lightest possible load)
- Monitor system resources (CPU, Memory) during testing
- Measure response times, success rates, and throughput

STRESS TEST RESULTS:

Users,Description,Success_Rate,RPS,Avg_Response_ms,Max_Response_ms,95th_Percentile_ms,System_Status
50,Moderate Stress,0,0,0,0,0,STRESSED
100,High Stress,0,0,0,0,0,STRESSED
200,Very High Stress,0,0,0,0,0,STRESSED
300,Extreme Stress,0,0,0,0,0,STRESSED
500,Maximum Stress,0,0,0,0,0,STRESSED

ANALYSIS:
- System stress threshold:  concurrent users
- Best overall performance: 0 RPS at 300 users
